            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My love for creating has lead me into studying programming, although I never thought it would lead me here. I excelled in art and literature, and in high school I had dreams of becoming a psychologist. I soon realized how many years of school it would take for a Masters degree and quickly gave up on that dream. <br> I learn best by being thrown into the flames of something new, and I tend to quickly gain my footing, so traditional school is not my go-to. A friend recommended a coding bootcamp and through some research on the biggest search engine of the internet I stumbled into the UW Full Stack Web Development online coding bootcamp. It's a struggle that I'm loving so far, thanks to my peers and instructors. I'm truly grateful to have taken this path as I head into my 20's this year(2023).</p>
