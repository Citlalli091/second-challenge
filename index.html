                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My love for creating has lead me into studying programming, although I never thought it would lead me here. I excelled in art and literature throughout my youth, and though I had delved into coding through school extracurriculars, I regrettably never took it seriously. I never thought this would be the cereer path I would end up going into, though I'm not complaining. <br><br>  This all started with a conversation with my cousin. Her partner is studying Computer Science at UW, and recommended it as a good career to go into. It piqued my interest and started doing some research about programs. A friend recommended a coding bootcamp and after some searching I stumbled upon the UW Full Stack Flex Web Development online coding bootcamp. It's a struggle that I'm loving so far, thanks to my peers and instructors. I'm truly grateful to have taken this path as I head into my 20's this year.</p>
