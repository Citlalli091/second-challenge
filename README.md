## User Story
    AS AN employer
    I WANT to be able to see a potential client's projects, contact information, and a snippet of information about them as a person
    SO THAT I can review their past work, get to know a little bit about them as a person, and finally contact them through info provided by the web application if they are deemed the right person for the job.
